 none of this works that well, the best way is to maintain the bouquet on the zgemma2 and have kodi use that

list everything for the given bouquet from zgemma2s:

curl 'http://zgemma2s/ajax/channels?id=1%3A7%3A1%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3AFROM%20BOUQUET%20%22userbouquet.freesat__tv_.tv%22%20ORDER%20BY%20bouquet&stype=tv'  > html
grep Zap html  | sed 's/.*zapChannel\(.\+\);.*$/\1/' > channels
# get names vs channel ids:

cat channels  | sed  "s/^.'\([0-9A-F\:]\+\)', '\([^']\+\)'.$/\2,\1/"
freesat numbers vs names:  http://www.tvchannelguide.co.uk/freesat.php
take that list and customise it for region



# we need to add a group into KODI called "Freesat (TV)" which we'll assume is channelgroup.idGroup = 3;
# if isn't then we need to add another one instead.


# show channels in freesat
SELECT * 
	FROM map_channelgroups_channels 
		INNER JOIN channels ON (channels.idChannel = map_channelgroups_channels.idChannel)
WHERE map_channelgroups_channels.idGroup = 3

# add channel from "all" into freesat:

INSERT INTO map_channelgroups_channels
(idChannel, idGroup, iChannelNumber, iSubChannelNumber, iOrder, iClientChannelNumber, iClientSubChannelNumber)
SELECT map_channelgroups_channels.idChannel, 3 AS idGroup, iChannelNumber, iSubChannelNumber, iOrder, iClientChannelNumber, iClientSubChannelNumber FROM map_channelgroups_channels 
	INNER JOIN channels ON channels.idChannel = map_channelgroups_channels.idChannel
WHERE 
	channels.idChannel = (SELECT MIN(idChannel) FROM channels WHERE channels.sChannelName = 'BBC One HD') 
	AND map_channelgroups_channels.idGroup = 1;

# delete all freesats
 --DELETE FROM map_channelgroups_channels  WHERE idGroup = (SELECT idGroup FROM channelgroups WHERE channelgroups.sName = 'Freesat (TV)')
